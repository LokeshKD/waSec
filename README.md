# Wasec

Examples and tutorials from the [WASEC book](https://leanpub.com/wasec).

Each of the directories in this repo has its own `README`, so go ahead and explore!
A good place to start? Check the [clickjacking example](https://github.com/odino/wasec/tree/master/clickjacking).

All the examples are tested on Google Chrome 65. Most of them can be run with
NodeJS -- I am using `v10.1.0` but anything above version 9 should work.
